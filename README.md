this is my CLI for a library interface which allows you to add or delete books and display all books, you can add a book by putting the name of the book then the author and then the ISBN of said book, if you type in display_books you will be shown a numbered list of all books and you can type delete_book and the respective number of said book from the list that you want to delete to remove it.
